This modpack includes a list of mods that are generally useful for admin work on dedicated serveers. Do not use this on dedicated servers without permission or to grief.

I suggest you make a seperate "Admin" character from your regular character as some of these mods (like item stacks and expanded inventory) will lose their extra items if you log into that character without those mods.
 
If you're from [Comfy Valheim](https://discord.gg/ameHJz5PFk) please first install the basic [Comfy Valheim Pack](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ComfyMods/ComfyValheimPack/). Comfy also has some additional non-public mods and if you're staff that's meant to have those tools you will have to ask for them from staff and install them into the profile folder.

## Manual Installation of Mods to work with Thunderstore Profiles
0. Download the mod you want, it's usually a zip file so right click and extract here and then click into the extracted folder. 
1. Select your mod profile in Thunderstore
2. On the left, go to "Settings"
3. Click "Browse profile folder"
4. Go into the "BepInEx" folder
5. Go into the plugins folder
6. Add .dll files of the mod you want here. 

Sometimes mod zip folders have more than just a .dll folder in them. In that case they generally will go in the "BepInEx" folder instead but refer to installation instructions for each mod if that doesn't work.
