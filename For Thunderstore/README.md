# The Admin Pack
This modpack includes a list of mods that are generally useful for admin work on dedicated servers. Do not use this on dedicated servers without permission or to grief.

* I suggest you make a seperate profile on Thunderstore with a name like "ADMIN MODE" so you don't mix it up with your regular mods. 
* I also suggest you create a separate "Admin" character as some of these mods (like item stacks and expanded inventory) will lose their extra items if you log into that character without those mods.

### Comfy Valheim Server 
If you're from [Comfy Valheim](https://discord.gg/ameHJz5PFk) please first install the basic [Comfy Valheim Pack](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ComfyMods/ComfyValheimPack/). Comfy also has some additional non-public mods and if you're staff that's meant to have those tools you will have to ask for them. This modpack is only for approved staff.
