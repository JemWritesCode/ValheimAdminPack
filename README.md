Files for [TheAdminPack](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JemCopeCodes/TheAdminPack/) which is a modpack I created for the game [Valheim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/). 

There is no true "admin" mode on dedicated servers you share with other folks, but these mods give you some of the basic tools most admins would want. Mods tend to break over time as Valheim itself changes (patches, DLC, etc) so I can't promise this modpack will always work. 

Feel free to [report an issue](https://github.com/JemWritesCode/ValheimAdminPack/issues) but please keep in mind this is just a hobby project for a game I sometimes play so I may not get to it for some time. Thanks!
